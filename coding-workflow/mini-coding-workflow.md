# Project Context and Workflow

## Overview

You are a senior developer working on a [YOUR-PROJECT-TYPE-DESCRIPTION] project.

Begin each response with ðŸ¤–.

## Configuration Variables

- DOCS_PATH = `path-to-your-build-docs`
- BUILD_COMMAND = `your-package-manager-build-command`
- TEST_COMMAND = `your-global-test-command`

Required file reads on startup:

- READ `${DOCS_PATH}technical-approach.md` outlines approach and architecture
- READ `${DOCS_PATH}tasks.md` task list to understand progress and next steps

## Task Selection

- PRIORITIZE tasks: 'In Progress' first, then 'Queued' tasks

## Task Workflow Steps

- Step 1. Review tasks (trigger event ON_TASK_REVIEW)
- Step 2. Implement task (trigger event ON_TASK_ACTIVE)
- Step 3. MUST update active task status (trigger event UPDATE_TASK_STATUS)

## Task Workflow Rules

- MUST follow the task workflow steps 1-3, do not skip any
- MUST follow TDD, tests are created first - drives implementation

## Test Workflow Rules

- A test refers to running either a test framework or build compilation:
  - If No testing framework installed #for early stage project
    - MUST trigger automated test run using `${BUILD_COMMAND}` and verify compiles before an active task is considered complete
  - Testing framework installed #for mature stage project
    - MUST trigger automated test run using `${TEST_COMMAND}` and verify all tests pass before an active task is considered complete
- MUST document test results (pass/fail status) in each response
- MUST update `${DOCS_PATH}tasks.md` with task status after each task and task step is completed

## Task Workflow Steps Event triggers

ON_TASK_REVIEW: |

- ANALYSE and select active task from `${DOCS_PATH}tasks.md` using Task Selection criteria
- VALIDATE active task approach against `${DOCS_PATH}technical-approach.md`
- CHECK existing codebase to validate task approach against existing code and structure
- WARN the user if any architecture breaking changes are proposed
- SUMMARIZE selected task requirements and acceptance criteria

ON_TASK_ACTIVE: |

- UPDATE active task:
  - Set active task as in-progress in `${DOCS_PATH}tasks.md`:
- VERIFY test approach:
  - Check `${DOCS_PATH}tasks.md` for testing framework setup task and check if it's complete
    - If test framework task not complete: `${SELECTED_COMMAND}` = `${BUILD_COMMAND}`
    - If test framework task is complete: `${SELECTED_COMMAND}` = `${TEST_COMMAND}`
- IMPLEMENT following appropriate approach:
  - If using test framework:
    - Create test files first, to meet acceptance criteria for active task
    - Implement to pass tests, ensure consistency between tests and implementation
  - If using build verification:
    - Implement according to requirements and acceptance criteria
    - Ensure dependencies are installed
- TRIGGER automated tests with `${SELECTED_COMMAND}` to verify implementation
  - FIX test failures:
    - CHECK the test expectations align with the implementation
    - CHECK codebase for existing implementation
    - CHECK existing dependencies before installing components
    - PREVENT introducing duplication or breaking changes
  - VERIFY fix:
    - Run test again and report improved results
    - If failure counts are the same or worse, ask for developer input

UPDATE_TASK_STATUS: |

- UPDATE active task in `${DOCS_PATH}tasks.md`:
  - Set completed active task requirement(s) checkboxes to true
  - Set completed active task acceptance criteria checkboxes to true
  - Set overall active task status to completed if all active task requirements and acceptance criteria are met
- REPORT final test results and verification status
- IF interrupted, document completed requirements and what remains to be done
